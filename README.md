Summary: This is a bowling score game that lets you input/click on the number
of pins knocked out from 0 to 10. A strike is a total of 10 pins knocked out at once,
and a spare is a combined total of 10 pins knocked out in two hits per frame.
There are 10 frames with two hit frames from frame 1 to 9. The 10th frame can store up to 3 hits. If the total pins
knocked out is a spare or a strike. You'll get one to two more chances
depending on the number of pins knocked out. The score is calculated on how bowling traditionally works.
When you hit a strike or 10 pins, your score is calculated with the sum of the next two hits. When it's a spare 
or your total of two hits in one frame is totaled to 10, your current score is calculated with the total for 
the next hit. The maximum score for bowling is 300.
